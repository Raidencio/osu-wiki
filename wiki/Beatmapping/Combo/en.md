# Combo

*Not to be confused with the [score multiplier](/wiki/Score).*

**Combos** are groups of related [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) in [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) that share the same colour and award bonus health<!-- TODO: link --> when completed successfully. Groupings are most commonly done according to verses, measures, melodies, or visual patterns. Each combo starts with an object marked as a **new combo** (***NC***).

The `New Combo` button (or the shortcut `Q`) is on the right of the `Compose` tab of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor).

## Combo colour

*For regulations surrounding combo colours, see: [Ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

When a new combo is started, the current combo colour changes. Combo colours are defined by a mapper, and apply to all hit objects in a beatmap. Combo colouring is an important aspect to a beatmap's aesthetics, as it is one of the only ways to change the visuals of a beatmap besides [storyboarding](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) and [skinning](/wiki/Skinning). Combo colours can be set in the [Song Setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) panel, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 combo colours. Combo colours defined in a skin will only be used when a beatmapper does not define any combo colours, or when the player overrides it in their settings.

## osu!standard

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), each hit object in a combo has its own combo number, in addition to a combo colour. New combos start at 1 and count up, and spinners also force the next object to start a new combo. More health is recovered with [Geki and Katu](/wiki/Score#osu!) hit scores, which can be given from the last hit object in a combo.

## osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), each type of fruit is coloured in the order given. Droplets and fruits at the end of sliders will always have the same colour as the start fruit, however bananas will always have a tint of yellow. When a combo is completed, the fruits stacked on the catcher's plate will explode outwards.

## Other game modes

[osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) do not use combos.

## Colourhaxing

**Colourhaxing** refers to mappers setting specific colours to be used for new combos, instead of cycling through the available colors in order like default. This allows for full control over combo colours, and can be used to make different sections of a beatmap stand out. A very common way of doing this is to have the [kiai time](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Kiai_Time) use brighter combo colours than other sections to make it stand out even more.

Colourhaxing can be a very tedious process, as new combos are defined through references to earlier combos. This means that changing one combo will change all the following combos as well.
