# Countdown

*For tournament timers, see: [Tournament management commands](/wiki/osu!tourney/Tournament_Management_Commands)*  
*For regulations around countdowns, see: [Ranking criteria ยง General ยง Guidelines](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#guidelines)*

A countdown may appear in the beginning of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). This is useful for songs that start quickly and/or abruptly, but most beatmaps do not need this enabled. Countdowns can be toggled on/off in the [song setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) menu under the "Design" tab, but are not allowed for [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) beatmaps.

When enabled, the countdown animation can be controlled using the `Countdown Speed` buttons (`Half`, `Normal`, `Double`) and the `Countdown Offset` button. `Countdown Speed` buttons halve, double or keep the standard speed of the countdown animation. `Countdown Offset` sets the offset in [beats](/wiki/Glossary#beat) before the first [hit object](/wiki/Hit_Objects). For example, a countdown with offset 2 has its animation start 2 beats earlier than normal. For maps with intros, skipping goes directly to the countdown.

The countdown animation can be [skinned](/wiki/Skinning/Interface#countdown).
