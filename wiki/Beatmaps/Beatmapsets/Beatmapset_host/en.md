# Beatmapset host

A **beatmapset host** is the manager and uploader of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets). They create the majority of a mapset's difficulties and coordinate the creation of [guest difficulties](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Guest_difficulty). A beatmapset host is usually responsible for finding [mods](/wiki/Modding) and contacting [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) to push their beatmapset through the [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).
