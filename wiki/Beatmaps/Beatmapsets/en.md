# Beatmapsets

<!-- TODO: connect to the rest of the wiki, ultimately this should replace the Glossary entry and be clearly distinguished from "beatmaps" -->

A **beatmapset** is a set of [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) for the same song. The [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) shows all of the beatmapsets submitted online.

When multiple people contribute to a single mapset, the uploader is known as the [host](Beatmapset_host), and the rest are called "guests". Guests usually help by creating [guest difficulties](Guest_difficulty).

Beatmapsets are sometimes referred to as "beatmaps", but on this wiki "beatmap" usually means a single difficulty.
