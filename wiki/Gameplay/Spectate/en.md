# Spectate

<!-- TODO: needs to be combined with /wiki/Replay#spectator in some way -->

**Spectating** is when someone watches another player playing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) in real time. To spectate, open the extended chat and click on a grey user panel.

For this to work, you will need to have a copy of the exact same beatmap the player you wish to spectate is playing. However, if you have an [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) tag, the beatmapset will be downloaded and processed for you through osu!direct.
