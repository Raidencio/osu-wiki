# Slidertail

*Slidertail* or **sliderend**, refers to the ending portion of a [slider](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider) where the player can release their pressed key after having followed a [sliderbody](/wiki/Hit_object/Sliderbody). Slidertails are only found in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps). Slidertails can be either fully visible as a circle or invisible as part of the sliderbody, depending on which version your skin is using. The colour of slidertails is determined by the combo colours used by the mappers of a beatmap.
