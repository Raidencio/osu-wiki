# Time-distance equality

**Time-distance equality** is an [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) mapping technique where spacing between [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) on the playfield is proportional to the duration of time between them. This is automatically calculated by the [distance snap](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Distance_Snap) feature of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor).

In lower [difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties), time-distance equality is used to make gameplay more intuitive for new players.
