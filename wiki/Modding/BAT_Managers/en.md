# BAT Managers

**BAT Managers** (***BATm***) were the leaders of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (*BAT*). They were responsible for managing and mentoring team members, as well as raising awareness of important announcements and shaping the future goals and direction of the team.

## History

Following the promotion of all active members of the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (*MAT*) to the BAT, on the 15th of May, 2013, the BATm were appointed. Initially, one member of the BAT from each major geographical region was selected for the role: for the Americas, ![][flag_US] [Garven](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/244216), for Europe, ![][flag_FR] [Kurai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089), and for Asia, ![][flag_CN] [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679).

These positions were later held by ![][flag_US] [Charles445](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/85000), ![][flag_DE] [Loctav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71366), and ![][flag_CN] [popner](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/759860) from the 22nd of December, 2013 until the separation of the BAT into the Beatmap Nomination Group (later the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators)) and the Quality Assurance Team<!-- TODO: QAT stub --> on the 21st of August, 2014.
